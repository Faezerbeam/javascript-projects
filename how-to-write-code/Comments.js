   // This demo shows off comments!

   // console.log("This does not print.") so this DIDN'T need the semi-colon...

   console.log("Hello, World!"); // Comments do not have to start at the beginning of a line.

   /* Here is how
   to have
   multi-line
   comments. */ // It appears you CAN make multiple comments on the same line. // as many times as needed, huh... and it just extends the line by wrapping

   console.log("Comments make your code more readable by others.");
